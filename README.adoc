This repository contains all my NixOS configurations.

== Configurations

All my configurations are named after poisonous plants, not because I am toxic, but because I think they are cool.

* **Wisteria**: my desktop computer 
* **Foxglove**: my framework laptop
* **Hemlock**: my VPS machine
* **Ivy**: Home Assistant running on Raspberry PI
