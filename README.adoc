= NixOS configuration

This repository contains all my nixos configurations.

== Installing

Using my https://github.com/WJehee/nixos-installer[custom installer image]

1. Become root `sudo su`
2. Create the password for full disk encryption: `echo "MY_PASSWORD" > /tmp/secret.key`
3. `disko-format /PATH/TO/DISK`
4. `install-flake HOSTNAME`
5. Set root passwd after being prompted

After the install has finished, do the following:  

[,sh]
----
nixos-enter --root /mnt
passwd USERNAME
exit
reboot
----

== Server

These files also include the configuration for my personal web server,
which can be found under `nixos/wisteria/`.

= Notes

Old version of rebuild command, this should work but there is some doas stuff: https://github.com/WJehee/.dotfiles-nix/issues/31

`doas nixos-rebuild switch --flake ".#{{hostname}}" &>rebuild.log || grep -C 2 --color error rebuild.log`
