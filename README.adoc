This repository contains all my NixOS configurations.

== Configurations

All my configurations are named after poisonous plants, not because I am toxic, but because I think they are cool.

* **Wisteria**: my desktop computer 
* **Foxglove**: my framework laptop
* **Hemlock**: my VPS machine

=== Other names

* Nightshade
* Oleander
* Castor

== Installing

Using my https://github.com/WJehee/nixos-installer[custom installer image]

1. Become root `sudo su`
2. Create the password for full disk encryption: `echo "MY_PASSWORD" > /tmp/secret.key`
3. `disko-format /PATH/TO/DISK`
4. `install-flake HOSTNAME`
5. Set root passwd after being prompted

After the install has finished, do the following:  

[,sh]
----
nixos-enter --root /mnt
passwd USERNAME
exit
reboot
----
